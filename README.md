# MLOps Intro Course

The main goal of this course is to give a global overview mlops of tools, techniques and processess.

The focus is not to teach concrete platforms (such us Kubeflow or MLFlow) but underlying techologies, like Docker, FastAPI, data validation tools and so on. In addition, advanced Machine Learning techniques are dicussed in context of MLOps, such us custom models.


# Prerequisites
* Install Python 3.6+
* Install Docker (depends on OS)
* Create a Virtual Environment (Lesson 0)


# Lesson 0
* Setup

# Lesson 1: Your first app in Docker!
* Get to know Docker main commands
* Run an application in Docker
* Start a service in Docker

# Lesson 2:  Your first py process in Docker!
* Simple example on how to Dockerize a Py process

# Lesson 3: Deploy an inference Endpoint for RT predictions
* FastAPI
* Get model pickle
* Deploy a model in FastAPI endpoint (local)
* Add features to your endpoint: Data Validation and Storage Backend
* Dockerize a prediction service (TODO)

# Lesson 4: Dockerize a batch inference process (TODO)
